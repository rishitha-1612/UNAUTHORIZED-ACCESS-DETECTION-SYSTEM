The code provides a comprehensive security mechanism for a login system by combining image capture, face detection, location retrieval, and email notifications. It ensures that both Intruders and owners are appropriately managed:
For Owners: If the owner is detected but the password is incorrect, a password reset link is sent via email.
For Intruders: If an unauthorized person attempts to access the system and fails to enter the correct password within three attempts, an alert email with the intruder's image is sent to the legitimate user's email address.
This system enhances security by not only relying on password protection but also by using face recognition and geographical location as additional layers of verification.
